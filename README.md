Web Exersise One: Creating a Wesbsite Through GitHub

A data set that interested me was on Socioeconomic Data and Application

Center also known as SEDAC

Below is the link to a particularly interesting data set I found on infant mortality rates

[(https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/povmap-global-subnational-infant-mortality-rates-v2-01)]



In addition to the data sets I also came across a book through free-data-science-book
        
I found that an "Introduction to Social Network Methods" stood out to me whilst looking for different books 
        
This book was written by Robert Hanneman and Mark Riddle at the University of  California Riverside
        
 I picked this particular book because my undergraduate degree was in Sociology so I am drawn to the ideas
        
 behind Social Networks. Below is the link to the paper.
